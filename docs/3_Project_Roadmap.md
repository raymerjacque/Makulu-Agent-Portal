# Documentation: Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and long-term vision for the Makulu Agent Portal. Our goal is to create the most powerful and intuitive AI-native development environment, and this roadmap will guide our efforts and those of our community contributors.

---

## Short-Term Goals (Next 1-3 Months)

These are features and refinements we are actively working on and where community contributions can have an immediate impact.

*   **Expand Language Support (Community Focus):**
    *   **Priority:** Add robust agent plugins for **Python (Flask/Django)** and **Go**.
    *   **Secondary:** Begin development of plugins for **C# (.NET)** and **PHP (Laravel)**.
    *   **Goal:** Broaden the application's utility for the most popular backend languages.

*   **Refine the "Project CTO" Agent:**
    *   **Goal:** Enhance the CTO agent's ability to plan complex, multi-file changes for follow-up requests. This includes improving its understanding of existing codebases to make more intelligent modifications.

*   **Enhance Content Mode:**
    *   **Goal:** Introduce new specialized agents for different content types, such as a **"Screenplay Agent"** with proper formatting and a **"Technical Whitepaper Agent"** that can handle citations and data.

*   **Improve the Plugin Host:**
    *   **Goal:** Add more advanced testing features to the open-source Plugin Host, such as the ability to mock file system interactions and provide more complex dependency contexts for contributors.

*   **UI/UX Polish:**
    *   **Goal:** Act on early user feedback to refine the user interface, improve workflow clarity, and enhance the overall developer experience.

## Long-Term Vision (6-12+ Months)

These are more ambitious, foundational goals that will define the future of the platform.

*   **Visual "Agent Builder" UI:**
    *   **Vision:** Create a no-code/low-code interface within the application where users can design their own custom agents. Users would be able to define an agent's system prompt, its specialized knowledge, and chain multiple agents together to create unique, custom workflows.

*   **Community Plugin & Blueprint Marketplace:**
    *   **Vision:** Develop a searchable, browseable marketplace directly within the Makulu Agent Portal. Users could discover, rate, and install community-built language plugins and project blueprints with a single click.

*   **Full CI/CD Integration Agent:**
    *   **Vision:** An advanced "DevOps" agent that can securely connect to a user's GitHub or GitLab account. After generating a project, this agent would be able to automatically create a new repository, push the code, and set up a GitHub Actions or GitLab CI pipeline to build, test, and deploy the application.

*   **Real-time Collaborative Canvas Mode:**
    *   **Vision:** Evolve the Canvas Mode into a Google Docs-like collaborative experience. Multiple users could enter the same canvas, edit code or text simultaneously, and interact with the AI assistant together in a shared session.

*   **Expanding Beyond Code & Text:**
    *   **Vision:** Explore the possibility of agents that can generate other media types. This could start with an agent that can generate **Mermaid.js or PlantUML diagrams** from a description, and potentially expand to generating simple audio or video assets in the future.
